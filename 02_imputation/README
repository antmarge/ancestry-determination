# Pipeline for imputing/phasing using BEAGLE

This imputation pipeline takes genotype calls (vcf)
from the readProcessing pipeline and outputs
imputed and phased genotypes which can be used for
allele-frequency or haplotype-based analyses

Notes: Need a few more files
1. Genetic distance map
2. Imputation panel
